        <p>Rare Beauty is breaking down unrealistic standards of perfection. ​

            This is makeup made to feel good in, without hiding what makes you unique—because Rare Beauty is not about being someone else, but being who you are.</p>

        <h2>A Note From
            Our <em>Founder</em></h2>
        <p>I think Rare Beauty can be more than a beauty brand—it can make an impact. I want us all to stop comparing ourselves to each other and just start embracing our own uniqueness.</p>
